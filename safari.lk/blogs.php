Plenty of wildlife for you to see and lots to do.
        Leopard watching in Sri Lanka is a favorite activity that many tourists love to enjoy while visiting the island on a holiday. This subspecies of leopard that are considered as endangered are observed well in Sri Lanka. Below mentioned are some of the best National Parks that you can witness leopards.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Yala National Park<br/><p>Yala National Park is the 2nd largest wildlife park in Sri Lanka. The climate here is semi-arid with vast dry woodlands and open patches of grasslands and is divided into five blocks. Park also includes wide varieties of wildlife and plants. Two large rivers flow through the park and are home to about 32 species of mammals, 125 species of birds, along with many reptiles and lagoon fauna species.

        <li>Wilpattu National Park<br/><p>Wilpattu National Park is located west side of Anuradhapura & Wilpattu National Park has a good network of gravel roads. No wildlife excursions can be truly experienced unless you go on safari and Wilpattu National Park is no stranger to expeditions thus far and you can be sure that leopards will almost always make a grand entrance here. Wilpattu has lot of waterholes which are good places to observe wildlife. Jeep Safari is the regular norm in exploring the Wilpattu National Park. While the big 4 of Sri Lankan wild life the Leopard, Elephant, Sloth bear, Deer, endemic birds can be sighted easily during a half day safari. When youre on your wildlife safari in wilpattu you will find this elusive leopards cross the gravel roads of wilpattu forest and sometimes gliding through the undergrowth of forest for their next meal</p></li>

        <h2 class="post-title">7 tips on how to travel in Sri Lanka on a budget</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Published on May 23, 2023</p>
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>Sri Lanka is a popular backpacker destination and known to be really cheap. We gathered a few tips for all the travelers who are really on a budget. We travelled in Sri Lanka for 4 weeks and went all over, from the southern beaches through the cool tea filled central country all the way up to the isolated Jaffna. From there we explored the lesser known east coast all the way to Arugam Bay, from where we ascended again to Ella for some more tea because it's just so beautiful. For detailed itineraries and tips on specific places, welcome to our blog, but you can already read the saving tips here.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Eat local</b> <br/><p>Don't go to fancy restaurants, eat where the locals eat instead.The curry is so delicious everywhere and we never had any stomach issues. Buy fresh fruit and snacks at local markets and fill up your water at filling stations, they can be found in every city.</p></li>
            <li><b>Sleep in family-run guesthouses</b> <br/><p>The smaller locally run guesthouses are usually also the cheapest. We really enjoyed staying there, as the food was always fresh and prepared with love, and the owners took care of us as if we were their family. And let's face it, if you're out exploring the whole day, in the evening you don't need anything else besides a clean shower and a bed.</p></li>
            <li><b>Ditch alcohol</b><br/><p>Alcohol, including beer, is quite expensive in Sri Lanka. If you really want to save money, ditch alcohol during your visit.</p></li>
            <li><b>Skip the expensive entrance fees</b> <br/><p>We were quite surprised by the entrance fees to Sigiriya (around 30 dollars). We suggest that you visit the neighboring Pidurangala Rock instead, which (in our opinion) offers a much nicer view and is way cheaper.
              <br/>If you visit Kandy for the Perahera Festival, don't buy expensive tourist tickets. Just try to get a good spot on the sidewalk (be aware, you will have to be there very early) among the locals. It helps if you have snacks with you and share them with the locals around you.</p></li>
            <li><b>Get a local SIM card</b> <br/><p>A local SIM card will help you while planning and booking, and will save you some time while using Google Maps.<br/>
              Imagine getting out of the bus and navigating your way to your guest house, almost every tuk-tuk driver will try to take you there, even if it's relatively near, so he can make some money. But with Google Maps, you know where to go and you can decide whether you're going to accept their offer or rather walk.
              <br/>You can buy the SIM card at the airport and as with any other SIM card there are different providers. After doing some research, we decided on Dialog, which is really good, has good coverage and costs only around 9 dollars.</p></li>
            <li><b>Have the right travel insurance</b> <br/><p>In Sri Lanka, we had some health issues for the first time while traveling. Although medical services were still very reasonably priced, we spent around 120 euros for all the treatments and medications. Luckily, we had travel insurance and were therefore refunded every penny. Imagine being on a tight budget and that you have to spend money on doctors. It can shorten your trip significantly.</p></li>
        </ol>

    <p>Hopefully, we gave you some ideas on how to save money.

      <p class="post-meta">Published on May 23, 2023</p>
      <div class="post-content">
      <p>A farm stay experience is something everybody dreams of having but only a few get to experience. Here's an opportunity to live and learn firsthand the everyday happenings of a real working farm situated in the rural outback of Wellawaya. On arrival at this 10-acre rustic hideout, which borders both the Lunugamvehera and Weheragala National Parks, you will be shown an eco abode, which you will call home for the next few days. This down to earth dwelling (sans luxury trappings) is a clean wattle and daub hut, which consists of two bedrooms with ground and upper floor lounges that overlook the lake. Each room comes with a king sized bed, mosquito net and attached bathroom with uncovered shower. Enjoy traditional Sri Lankan meals prepared using the fresh produce of the farm.<br/>
        Be up at dawn to watch the farmhands start their day. After a refreshing cup of tea and a wholesome breakfast stroll through Orange, Mango, Banana, Papaya plantations in addition to hundreds of carefully tendered vegetable plots. You can also lend a hand at tilling the soil, watering the plants and gathering the produce. Learn about the plants, its medicinal values and health benefits and how the locals benefit from the project. Watch the soil being tilled, fertilized and prepared for planting and the produce being carefully hand harvested. After enjoying a healthy lunch take time to rest, bath in the nearby lake or do some bird watching, you will not be disappointed as the farm itself is home to over 30 species of birds. You can also indulge in traditional cooking, riding a tractor, fishing, canoeing and conventional curd making.<br/>
        Take a safari to the nearby Lunugamwehera National Park to see leopards, crocodile, spotted deer and other wildlife in addition to plenty of Elephants for which the Lunugamwehera National Park is popularly known. While enjoying the wildlife around be treated to some welcome sundowners seated on the rocky overhang.<br/>
        The matchlessness of this destination is the opportunity to see plenty of Elephants in large herds as they pas through the property (located at the edge of the Elephant Pass), bath playfully in the river or just laze around. It's like having the Elephants in your own backyard; you can watch them undisturbed from your room balcony!<br/>
